## ACT Node

Now that we've cleaned and processed our data, we can use `glatos`' built-in plotting tools to make quick and effective visualizations out of it. One of the simplest visualizations is an abacus plot to display animal detections against the appropriate stations. To this end, `glatos` supplies a built-in, customizable `abacus_plot` function.

~~~
# Visualizing Data - Abacus Plots ####
# ?glatos::abacus_plot
# customizable version of the standard VUE-derived abacus plots


abacus_plot(detections_w_events,
            location_col='station',
            main='ACT Detections by Station') # can use plot() variables here, they get passed thru to plot()


~~~
{: .language-r}

This is good, but you can see that the plot is cluttered. Rather than plotting our entire dataset, let's try filtering out a single animal ID and only plotting that. We can do this right in our call to `abacus_plot` with the filtering syntax we've previously covered.

~~~
# pick a single fish to plot
abacus_plot(detections_filtered[detections_filtered$animal_id== "PROJ58-1218508-2015-10-13",],
            location_col='station',
            main="PROJ58-1218508-2015-10-13 Detections By Station")

{: .language-r}

Other plots are available in `glatos` and can show different facets of our data. If we want to see the physical distribution of our stations, for example, a bubble plot will serve us better.
